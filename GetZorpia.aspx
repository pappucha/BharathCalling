Suppose that a one-of-a-kind diamond is found in the remote countryside of Africa by a miner. An investor hears about the find, phones the miner and offers to buy the diamond for $1 million. The miner says she wants a day or two to think about it. In the interim, newspapers and other investors come forward and show their interest. With other investors apparently interested in the diamond, the miner holds out for $1.1 million and rejects the $1 million offer. Now suppose two more potential buyers make themselves known and submit bids for $1.2 million and $1.3 million dollars, respectively. The new asking price of that diamond is going to go up.
The following day, a miner in Asia uncovers 10 more diamonds exactly like the one found by the miner in Africa. As a result, both the price and demand for the African diamond will drop precipitously because of the sudden abundance of the once-rare diamond. This example - and the concept of supply and demand - can be applied to stocks as well.

What is the Bid price?

The "bid" is the current highest price at which you could sell. In the other word, if you want to sell your gold, in generally, you can sell it closest to the bid price but not the bid price.

What is the Ask price?

The ask is opposite of the bid. The "ask" is the current lowest price at which you could buy. As a rule, you buy it often higher than the ask price.

After realize the two terms, we should know another term "bid-ask spread". The difference between the bid price and the ask price is called the "bid-ask spread". If you would like to sell gold, a broker will offer to buy it for the bid price. And if you would like to buy it, the broker will offer to sell it to you for the ask price. The spread is the broker's profit. The ask price is always higher than the bid price, because nobody would like to lose money in business.

Take gold price for example, the bid $1583.00, the ask $1586.00. The spread for gold is (1586.00 - 1583.00 =3.00). The broker keeps the $3.00 /oz traded. Assume that gold trade 200 ozs today, and the average spread is $3.00. The broker gets a profit of 200 ozs * $3.00 = $600.

Don't forget, the most important of bid and ask price is that buyers pay the ask price and sellers receive the bid price.

Trend Analysis:
Let us consider with a practical example of Tata Motors . If we are planning to invest in this stock but need to confirm if the investment would be worth doing or not, then doing trend analysis could help us leaps and bounds. Here we are more interested to get a trend of only few factors such as “sales figure” and “operating profits”; as being an investor we should be more interested in them. I am considering the financial numbers from year 2002-2003 till 2011-2012 as it would give me a trend over 10 years.
http://stocksanalyser.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Financial-analysis.png

For calculating the trend we consider the figures for the year 2003 as base figure and then calculate the percentage rise or fall in the subsequent years.
sales trend (%) for 2004 = (sale in 2004 – sale in 2003)/sale in 2003 * 100

If index is in positive from yesterday and the share you are holding is in minus then it should be cut and if intraday trend of index is in buy then one should buy a stock in which is in plus.

If index is in minus then one should look to short stocks which are minus and not stocks which are in plus.
